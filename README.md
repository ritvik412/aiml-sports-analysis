 # ðŸš€ AI/ML Football Analysis System

This repository implements an end-to-end AI/ML pipeline for detecting, tracking, and analyzing football players, referees, and the ball in match footage. Leveraging state-of-the-art object detection (YOLO), clustering (KMeans), optical flow, and perspective transformation, the system quantifies key performance metricsâ€”such as ball acquisition percentage, player movement (in meters), speed, and distance coveredâ€”making it valuable for both beginners and experienced machine learning engineers.

# Key Features:-

1. Object Detection & Tracking: Detects players, referees, and footballs using YOL) (tracks them across frames).
2. Team Assignment: Segments and clusters jersey colors with KMeans to assign players to their respective teams.
3. Ball Acquisition Percentage: Computes the proportion of time each team possesses the ball.
4. Optical Flow for Camera Compensation: Measures camera movement between frames to isolate true player motion.
5. Perspective Transformation: Converts pixel coordinates into realâ€‘world distances (meters) by modeling scene depth.
6. Speed & Distance Calculation: Derives player speed and total distance covered using transformed coordinates.
