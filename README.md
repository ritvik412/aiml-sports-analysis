# AI/ML Football Analysis System ‚öΩüöÄ

![plot](Untitled+video+-+Made+with+Clipchamp.gif)

This repository implements an end-to-end AI/ML pipeline for detecting, tracking, and analyzing football players, referees, and the ball in match footage. Leveraging state-of-the-art object detection (YOLO), clustering (KMeans), optical flow, and perspective transformation, the system quantifies key performance metrics‚Äîsuch as ball acquisition percentage, player movement (in meters), speed, and distance covered‚Äîmaking it valuable for both beginners and experienced machine learning engineers.

## üìñ Project Overview:-

1. Object Detection & Tracking: Detects players, referees, and footballs using YOLO (tracks them across frames).
2. Team Assignment: Segments and clusters jersey colors with KMeans to assign players to their respective teams.
3. Ball Acquisition Percentage: Computes the proportion of time each team possesses the ball.
4. Optical Flow for Camera Compensation: Measures camera movement between frames to isolate true player motion.
5. Perspective Transformation: Converts pixel coordinates into real‚Äëworld distances (meters) by modeling scene depth.
6. Speed & Distance Calculation: Derives player speed and total distance covered using transformed coordinates.
